# LCBC Conversions <img src="man/figures/hex.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The repository contains functions to run coversions on certain raw data
in the database of LCBC.

The conversions covered so far:

  - IQ measures - conversions from raw to T, scaled and fullscale IQ
    scores  
  - MAP mean - blood pressure conversion

Vignettes are on their way.
