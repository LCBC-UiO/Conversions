The repository contains functions to run coversions on certain raw data in the database of LCBC.

The conversions covered so far:  

- IQ measures - conversions from raw to T, scaled and fullscale IQ scores  
- MAP mean - blood pressure conversion  

Thee functions are not properly cleaned and optimised yet. They are remnants of old scripts.
There are no unit tests.

Vignettes are written, but are old and do not explain the functions well, just the general consept.
