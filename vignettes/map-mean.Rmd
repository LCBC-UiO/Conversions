There are two functions for blood pressure in this package.
One for calculating the mean of the bloodspressure measurement, since we measure it several times.
And the other to calulcate the mean arterial pressure (MAP).

MAP is calculated with the following formulae:

$$ MAP \simeq \frac{(2 \times diastolic) + systolic}{3} $$
